### Homework Assignment: Basic Login System using Tkinter

#### Objective:
Students will create a basic login system using Tkinter in Python. 
The system will have input fields for username and password, and a button to submit the entries.
When the submit button is pressed, the program will print out the entered username and password.

#### Instructions:

1. **Setup Tkinter:**
   - Import the `tkinter` module.
   - Create the main application window.

2. **Create Input Fields:**
   - Create a label and entry widget for the username.
   - Create a label and entry widget for the password (use `show='*'` to hide the password).

3. **Create Submit Button:**
   - Create a button that, when clicked, will trigger a function to print the entered username and password.

4. **Display Widgets:**
   - Arrange the labels, entry fields, and button using grid or pack layout.

5. **Print User Entries:**
   - Define a function that retrieves the text from the entry widgets and prints it to the console.


#### Tips:
- Test your program to ensure it runs without errors.
- Make sure the submit button correctly prints the username and password.
- Experiment with different layouts and styling to make the interface more user-friendly.
