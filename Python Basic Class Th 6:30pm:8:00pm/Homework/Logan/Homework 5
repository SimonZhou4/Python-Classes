#Answer 1
# - Lists: Mutable data structures in Python used to store collections of values.
# - Tuples: Immutable data structures in Python used to store collections of values.
# - Indexing: The process of accessing elements in a list or tuple using their position.
# - Mutable: Data structures that can be modified after creation.
# - Immutable: Data structures that cannot be modified after creation.




#Answer 2
#A list and a tuple is different because lists
#are mutable data structures and tuples are
#immutable data structures.
#============
#Lists
#============
fruit_list=["orange","apple","grape"]
fruit_list.append("orange")
print(fruit_list)
#============
#Tuples(It will show a error.)
#============
friut_tuple=("orange","apple","grape")
friut_tuple.append("orange")
print(friut_tuple)




#Answer 3
#I don't know the answer for number 3




#Answer 4
number_list=["one","two","three","four"]
number_list.append("five")
number_list.remove("one")
number_list[2]="ten"
print(number_list)


#Answer 5
color_tuple=("red","green","purple","blue")
color_amount=("3","6","1","5")
color_tuple[2]="white"
print(color_tuple)


#Answer 6

#First, lists and tuples have a few differences.Lists
#and tuples also have some similarities.But only a 
#few.

#Next, lists and tuples both store collections of
#values.Lists and tuples are different because tuples
#are immutable and lists are mutable, but tuples 
#aren't.

#Lastly, those are the difference and similarities
#between a tuple and a list.
