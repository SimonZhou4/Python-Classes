#List is a data type that is mutable
#Tuble is a data type that inmutable
#Index can select variable from list and tuple also store information of list
#Mutable means can change
#Inmutable means cannot change

#List is mutable but tuple wasn't
 
num1=[1,2,3,4,5]
num2=(6,7,8,9,10)

#Index select data
print(num1[0])
print(num2[0])

num1.append(1)
num1.remove(1)
num1[0]=(11)
print(num1)

tuple=("1","2","3","4","5")
print(tuple[0])
#tuple[0]=1 :I tried

mix=tuple+num2
print(mix)
# The different between tuple and list is that can be change but one cannot.
#The list is mutable which means it be use on character health stat andd more
#Tuple cannot change which means it can use to create play button or somthing you don't want it to change
#The both store data , can select data . It works almost the same but just that one part.
