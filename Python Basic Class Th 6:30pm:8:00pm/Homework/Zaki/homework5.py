# 1 a list is a thing that contians thing. 
# a tupple is a thing that contain infromation but cannot be changed but can be conbined
# a indexing is when changing some inside the code
# a mutability is a is a object that can be changed
# a immutabililty is when something can't be changed
# 2 a list is something u can change and a tuple cannot be changed
# 3 so basicly a indexing in lists and tuple is like see if the are there

# firstly, i would use list for remenbering or least important thing.
# then lists you can change some i won"t need to be that careful if i make a mistake.
# but then tuples i would use an important thing so u can"t change the stuff and others.
# next, but you can still combine turples so when i use list I can change so mistakes are fine but if i use turples it maybe more inportant.
# the similartity is both contian and act same but tuples you can't change.
