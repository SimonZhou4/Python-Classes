# Programming is like giving instructions to a robot or a computer
# Just like how you might give directions to a friend to bake a cake
# or play a game

# What is a variable?
# A variable is like a box or a container that holds information. A variable 
# must have a name and it can hold different types of information
# such as : numbers, words or more complex things


# Make a variable
number = 10

number = "grace"


#Valid Variable Names
# - Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore(_)
# ex. 'my_variable', '_variable1', 'Name'
# - Can contain letters, numbers(0-9) or underscores
# ex. 'My_var_var_123', name123456789'
# Variables are case-sensitive
# ex. 'myVariable' , 'MyVariable', myvariable'
# there are all different variables
# - Cannot be usign a reserved keyworkd in Python
# ex. if, else, for, def, return, etc.


# Invalid Variables
# - Cannont start with a number
# ex. INVALID: '2variable', '123'
# - Cannot contain any special character(except underscore)
# ex. 'my-variable', 'my@variable', ' my!variable'
# - cannot contain spaces
# ex. 'my variable', 'myVariable I like'


# What is Syntax?
# Syntax is like the grammer or rules of a language. Python has its
# own set of rules that you need to follow to write code correctly

# Exercises
# Assignment operator '=' assigns a value to your variable

number = 5
number2 = 1.5

word = "happy"
Word = "sad"

print(number)
print(number2)
print(word)
print(Word)


# Arithmetic Operators
# Addition
SUM = number + number 
print(SUM)

#Subtraction
diff = number - number2
print(diff)

#Multiplicatin
mult = number * number2

#Dvision
div = number / number2


# Invalid operation
SUM = number + word
# Explain why? 



# 1. Assign a variable named "x" - 10
x = 10
# 2. Assign a variable named "y" - 150

# 3. Create 4 new variables that hold + , - , / , * 
mySum = x + y

# 4. Print out the 4 variables that were created
print(mySum)
